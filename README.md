# Project10
Full Stack App with React and a REST API

This project uses React to create a client for a school database REST API that was created in a previous project. The full stack application will provide a way for users to administer a school database containing information about courses: users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, viewing detail for a specific course, as well as creating, updating, and deleting courses in the database.

In addition, this project will require users to create an account and sign in to make changes to the database.
